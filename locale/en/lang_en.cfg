welcome-text=The refueling tower is a machine that can refuel vehicles, spidertrons, trains and vehicle/player equipment grids in its range. A refueling tower will transfer items from its inventory to fuel inventories nearby. Only one type of target can be fueled at once. To set the type of target that gets refueled by the tower you can use the GUI, that appears when clicking the tower.
